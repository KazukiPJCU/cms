  <h2>Reflection and Insights</h2>
  <p>Learning Joomla was a challenging process, as the program initially is very overwhelming. However, with time and practice, I became more comfortable managing the site structure and incorporating extensions to enhance functionality.</p>

  <p>Working with Joomla templates helped me appreciate the platform's flexibility and adaptability. While Joomla's learning curve was steeper than WordPress, I found that using this CMS allowed me to tackle more complex web projects confidently.</p>
  <p>One issue I had while working with Joomla was editing the CSS files in the template, as it's just a wall of CSS text without any gaps or spacing.</p>
  <p>Changing colors on Joomla was also an issue because the website colors wouldn't update sometimes without clearing the browser cache. This caused me to have to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
  <p>WordPress, on the other hand, was much more user-friendly when designing and updating a website.</p>
  <p>As a beginner, I found the platform's interface intuitive and easy to navigate, making it a breeze to create new pages, posts, and menus.</p>
  <p>Creating websites with WordPress was generally quicker and more straightforward than with Joomla, but I found that WordPress's lack of advanced customization meant that I had to look for additional plugins.</p>
  <p>Overall, Joomla allowed for more customization at the cost of ease of use, while WordPress enabled me to create a website more efficiently, at the cost of customization.</p>
  <p>For my chosen hosting, I used SiteGround and Joomla to host my WordPress CMS website and Joomla CMS website, respectively.</p>
  <p>On SiteGround, I had to pay for a server subscription to host my WordPress site, as I had previously created a SiteGround profile and wasn't able to get the student discount. Which cost something on the lines of $45+, an expense I could of done without</p>
  <p>Joomla, on the other hand, was completely free and auto-installed Joomla for me to begin creating my website.</p>
  <p>At times, the Joomla admin control panel would stop working or not allow me to log in. This issue was fixed by restarting the browser.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, SiteGround had a one-click installer for WordPress and was generally easier to navigate and never locked me out of the admin panel.</p>
